# Kozak-nsp-Mutation-Finder
A mutation finder program adapted from Bloom Lab's SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_HAARVI_sera, used to
collect data on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SARS-CoV-2 for a senior thesis.

How to Use:
- Install Anaconda or another python environment manager
- Run pip install -r requirements.txt
